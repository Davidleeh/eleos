this program needs the color FERET dataset

download:
Get the colorferet dataset from: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/color-feret-database (wget)

untar:
tar xzf colorferet.tar

preprocess:
./convert_images.sh

The code expects the preprocessed dataset to be in the same folder as the executable with a dir named: "images_raw". Create a symlink to it from the file system.

You can then run the server with: ./sample [-l]
For running with different configurations (#Threads\Use SUVM\Use RPC see defines in the code).
